## About Me

My name is Owen Laney, and I'm a student and developer living in the United States. I mostly program for fun, and I'll post all of my projects on **this site!**

## The Site

This website is a collection of all my software-related projects, and it has a blog where I write about the processes and technologies I use in those projects. It's also a portfolio of sorts - the second section of my homepage includes the projects I've contributed to.

## How it Works

I made this wesite using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static content generator that turns markdown files into html. To make a new post, all I have to do is make a file with the .md extension and put it in the right folder, and jekyll will do the rest! I'm going to post a more in-depth breakdown of how I made this site soon, and until then you can check out my website's [github repo](https://github.com/owen-laney/owen-laney.github.io).
